A local clinic uses an appointment management system which maintains a binary search tree to store appointments. Each appointment (name, appointment time) is a tuple of two strings, e.g. ('Alice Baker', '10:30'), and is represented by a node in the tree. Order is maintained by appointment time. The alphabetical order of the patient name is used to break ties. During data retrieval (i.e. to print out all of the appointments), a pre-order traversal is used, starting from the root node. 
The clinic’s appointment-scheduling software represents each booking as a node (name, appointment time) as a tuple of two strings, e.g. ('Alice Baker', '10:30'), in a binary-search tree (BST). The BST is maintained based on the chronological order of appointment times. When two patients book the same time slot, the alphabetical order of their names is used as a tiebreaker. To review the day’s schedule, the system performs a pre-order traversal of the tree. 
A clinic maintains appointments in a binary-search tree, where each node is an appointment (name, appointment time) as a tuple of two strings, e.g. ('Alice Baker', '10:30'). Appointments are ordered by appointment time. When two appointments share the same time, the patient’s name acts as a secondary key. Printing the schedule invokes a pre-order traversal of the BST from the root node. 
You need to store all appointments for a clinic as a binary search tree. Each phone-in booking is converted into a node (name, appointment time) as a tuple of two strings, e.g. ('Alice Baker', '10:30'), and inserted into a binary-search tree that is keyed primarily by time. If the two times are identical, the patients’ names are compared alphabetically as a secondary key. The clinic prints the schedule using pre-order traversal on the tree. 
A clinic records every appointment (name, appointment time) as a tuple of two strings, e.g. ('Alice Baker', '10:30'), in a binary-search tree ordered by appointment time. For two bookings at precisely the same time, a secondary ordering on patient names is applied. A pre-order traversal of the tree is used to display the schedule.
