Across the galaxy, a network of planets is linked by ancient space tunnels. A Star Courier is an interstellar spaceship that must travel from a designated starting planet to all connected planets using the bidirectional space tunnels. The Star Courier will plan its journey using depth-first search for traversal. During the search, if there are multiple next planets that can be traversed, the Star Courier will choose the one with the alphabetically smallest name. 
Across the Milky Way, planets form an ancient interplanetary network where some pairs of planets are connected via two-way space tunnels. A Star Courier starts from a starting planet and is on a mission to traverse all other planets in the connected network. The courier generates its flight plan offline with a depth-first-search (DFS) algorithm. During the search, when several candidate neighbors exist, it chooses the one whose planet name is lexicographically smallest.
You pilot a Star Courier through a galaxy of planets. Your job is to travel to as many planets as possible via bidirectional space tunnels, starting from a source planet. The courier computes its route with depth-first search, and whenever multiple unvisited neighbors are available it selects the neighbor with the alphabetically earliest planet name. 
A lattice of two-way space tunnels knits together the galaxy’s planets. A Star Courier must travel from a specified origin planet to all other connected planets. Prior to launch, the ship’s navigation computer executes a depth-first search over the planetary graph, breaking ties by picking the unvisited neighbor whose name is smallest in dictionary order. 
A Star Courier is missioned to travel to as many planets as possible in the galaxy network from a source planet. The planets are connected via ancient space tunnels. The courier’s route-planner employs depth-first search. Starting at the source, it recursively visits untraversed neighbors, always choosing the lexicographically minimal planet name among the available options.
