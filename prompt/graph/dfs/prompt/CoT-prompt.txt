Q: The graph consists of nodes [35, 44, 59, 64, 83], and edges [(83, 59), (83, 44), (64, 59), (64, 44), (35, 59), (35, 44), (59, 44)].
What is the depth-first search path starting from node 44?
A: Starting depth-first search (DFS) from node 44.
Visiting node 44. Current DFS path: [44].
It has neighbors [35, 59, 64, 83], and [] are visited.
Going deeper from 44 to 35.
Visiting node 35. Current DFS path: [44, 35].
It has neighbors [44, 59], and [44] are visited.
Going deeper from 35 to 59.
Visiting node 59. Current DFS path: [44, 35, 59].
It has neighbors [35, 44, 64, 83], and [35, 44] are visited.
Going deeper from 59 to 64.
Visiting node 64. Current DFS path: [44, 35, 59, 64].
It has neighbors [44, 59], and [44, 59] are visited.
Backtracking from 64.
Going deeper from 59 to 83.
Visiting node 83. Current DFS path: [44, 35, 59, 64, 83].
It has neighbors [44, 59], and [44, 59] are visited.
Backtracking from 83.
Backtracking from 59.
Backtracking from 35.
Backtracking from 44.
DFS complete. 
The final DFS path is [44, 35, 59, 64, 83].
