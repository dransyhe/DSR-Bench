Q: Start with an empty red-black tree. What is the final state of the red-black tree after performing the operations?
Insert: 1
Insert: 54
Delete: 1
Insert: 90
Insert: 17
A: 
Insert 1 as a red leaf. Since it is the root, recolor it black. 
Insert 54 as a red leaf. Since 54 > 1, it is the right child of 1. 
Delete 1. It's only child is 54 (red). Rotate 54 to the root and recolor it black. 
Insert 90 as a red leaf. It is the right child of 54. 
Insert 17 as a read leaf, it is the left child of 54. 
Finally, we traverse the tree in pre-order, giving [[54, 'b'],[17, 'r'],[90, 'r']].
