Q: The root node is Node 10. Node 10's left child is Node 5, and its right child is Node 15. Node 5's left child is Node 3, and its right child is Node 7.  
What is the pre-order traversal of the tree?

A: 
Start at the root node, which is 10. Visit 10. The list so far is: [10].
Next, visit the left subtree of 10. The left child of 10 is 5. Visit 5. The list now is: [10, 5].
Next, visit the left subtree of 5. The left child of 5 is 3. Visit 3. The list now is: [10, 5, 3]. Since 3 has no children, return to node 5.
Next, visit the right subtree of 5. The right child of 5 is 7. Visit 7. The list now is: [10, 5, 3, 7]. Since 7 has no children, return to 10. 
Next, visit the right subtree of 10. The right child of 10 is 15. Visit 15. The list now is: [10, 5, 3, 7, 15].
Next, since 15 has no children, the traversal is complete.
The final pre-order traversal is: [10, 5, 3, 7, 15].
