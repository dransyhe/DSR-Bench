Q: You are given an empty skip list with max level 3, what is the final state of the skip list after the following operations? 
insert 43
Level generation probabilities: 0.1412 0.6574
insert 3
Level generation probabilities: 0.9823
delete 3
insert 89
Level generation probabilities: 0.4328 0.7636
delete 89
A: Initially, the skip list is [].
After inserting 43, it becomes [[43]].
Its first generation probability is 0.1412, which is below 0.5. 
Since the max level is not reached, it gets promoted to the next level 1: [[43], [43]].
Its second generation probability is 0.6574, which is above 0.5, so it stops. 
After inserting 3, it becomes [[43], [3, 43]] by keeping the elements at each level in ascending order.
Its first generation probability is 0.9823, which is above 0.5, so it stops. 
After deleting 3, it becomes [[43], [43]].
After inserting 89, it becomes [[43], [43, 89]] by keeping the elements at each level in ascending order.
Its first generation probability is 0.4328, which is below 0.5. 
Since the max level is not reached, it gets promoted to the next level 1: [[43, 89] [43, 89]].
Its second generation probability is 0.7636, which is above 0.5, so it stops. 
After deleting 89, it becomes [[43], [43]].
Its final state is [[43], [43]].
