Q: What is the state of the heap after the following operations:  
(insert, 52)  
(insert, 33)  
(insert, 81)  
(delete)  
(insert, 26)  
A: The heap is initially empty.  
(insert, 52) → [52]  
(insert, 33) → [33, 52]  
(insert, 81) → [33, 52, 81]  
(delete) → Removes 33 → [52, 81]  
(insert, 26) → [26, 81, 52]  
The final answer is [26, 81, 52].
