Given an array [75, 30, 13, 58, 31]. Delete the first item that has the value 30 in the array.
Q: What is the updated array?
A: The original array is [75, 30, 13, 58, 31].
The first occurrence of 30 is at index 1.
Removing the value at index 1, the updated array becomes [75, 13, 58, 31].
The final answer is [75, 13, 58, 31].
