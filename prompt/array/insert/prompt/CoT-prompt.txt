Given an array [6, 62, 21, 5, 56], starting with index 0. Insert an item of value 18 at index 3.
Q: What is the updated array?
A: The original array is [6, 62, 21, 5, 56].
Inserting 18 at index 3 shifts the elements from index 3 onwards to the right.
The updated array becomes [6, 62, 21, 18, 5, 56].
The final answer is [6, 62, 21, 18, 5, 56].
