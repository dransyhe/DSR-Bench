Given an array [95, 44, 29, 66, 83].
Q: What is the reversed array?
A: The original array is [95, 44, 29, 66, 83].
Reversing the array means swapping the first and last elements, which gives [83, 44, 29, 66, 95].
Then reverse the second and second-to-last elements, [83, 66, 29, 44, 95].
The updated array becomes [83, 66, 29, 44, 95].
The final answer is [83, 66, 29, 44, 95].
